# Getting Started

Here is how you can get started on the Discord bot portion of analog-tsx.

### Dev environment 
If you want to setup a developer environment where you can restart the bot and compile it
```sh
cd apps/bot
```
```sh title="/home/apps/bot"
npm run watch
```


Do `cd ../` to move up a directory

```sh title="/home/"
npm run dev
```
:::tip Pro tip

You can also just start the bot in the bot directory without starting the dashboard
```sh title="/home/apps/bot"
npm run dev
```
