# Dev Environment

As said in [the intro](./intro#developer-mode) you can enter developer mode by running `npm run dev` in the root of the project. This will start a development server that will automatically reload when you make changes to the code. It will also start a watcher that will automatically rebuild the project when you make changes to the code.
