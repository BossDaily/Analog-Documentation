# Intro
If you're reading this that means you're interested in learning how to building a Discord bot with a webpanel. 
You've come to the right place as this is one of the easiest ways to build a Discord bot with a webpanel.
We've tried to simplify some of the hardest and most annoying aspects of this. You will learn:
- Bot Slash commands
- Message Components: 
    - Buttons
    - Select Menus
    - Modals
- Build a dashboard UI with TailwindCSS & NextJS
- Handle authentication
- Create and manage a database 
- Query Discord's API from the dashboard

## Before you Start
You're going to need to know some things before you can begin to start working with the framework. 
Most important thing you need to know is Javascript & Typescript, as that is the main language of the framework, and it is needed for both the bot & the dashboard.
For the Discord bot you mainly need to know Discord.JS which is a javascript library that easily allows you to interact with the Discord API. 
For the dashboard you need to know React, NextJS, and TailwindCSS (or just normal CSS, Tailwind isn't needed but prefered).
They're also crutial libraries that you need to know for the framework to work properly. Those are NextAuthJS, TurboRepo, and Prisma.
